# Django ChatGPT Chatbot

## OpenAI Key

Ensure you login first with admin/password in admin site.

The go to site.

This works with OpenAI Key saved in the .env file.

Rename `.env.sample` to `.env` and supply your OpenAI Key.

Usual Django set up - this works with `python manage.py runserver` with admin/password as credentials.

Go to site/admin and login then got to site/chatbot or site/chatbot_app.

Thanks to Tom Dekan for the latter and the former is widely given in examples on the web.
