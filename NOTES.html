  <h2 id="httpsaiagentsdirectorycomlandscape"><a
      href="https://aiagentsdirectory.com/landscape">https://aiagentsdirectory.com/landscape</a></h2>
  <p>we can see that there are many examples of AI Agent Frameworks and
    they seem to increase each week.</p>
  <h2 id="aim">Aim</h2>
  <p>What I would like to achieve in this talk is to
    <strong>demystify</strong> and <strong>simplify</strong> AI Agents and
    AI Programming because it can seem like it is another different world of
    dev.
  </p>
  <p>What if AI Agents were ‘just’ Python code with a REST API call,
    admittedly a very magical API?</p>
  <p><em>AI (Agents) as API</em>…</p>
  <p>Then, we would use day to day Python design patterns to handle the
    responses we get back from the AI Agent and move on to the next step.
    Business as usual for Python/Django developers.</p>
  <p>This is the main focus of the talk - <strong>demystify and
      simplify</strong> - and this will enable you to create AI Agents and
    also construct workflows using AI Agents.</p>
  <p>With that in mind, we don’t need to fully grasp the code this time
    around.</p>
  <p>It is more about seeing the high level view and once can dig deeper
    into the code offline.</p>
  <p><em>Look at the patterns and structure rather than the code
      details</em> - it is what helped me get to grips with this new
    paradigm.</p>
  <p>We will use Notebooks to explore AI Agents and then we will see an
    implementation of an AI Agent in Django, using the same code.</p>
  <p>It is the same code that produces the same output for us to use in
    our Django App. <em>There is not extra ‘wiring’ involved to use AI
      Agents in Django</em>.</p>
  <p>There is a demo and sample code to illustrate the FAQ use case which
    we will see later.</p>
  <p>Like getting data back from the database, we get data back from an
    LLM request to use as we wish.</p>
  <h2 id="180-degrees">180 degrees</h2>
  <p><img src="./images/mouse-up.jpg" alt="mouse up" /> <img src="./images/mouse-down.jpg" alt="mouse down" /></p>
  <p>I like to use the metaphor of the upside down computer mouse. When we
    try to use it, it can take while to reverse our apporach. It is still
    the same set of movements - left, right, up and down - but in the
    opposite way to the way we are used to.</p>
  <p>There are 3 areas concerning Agentic AI in my opinion:</p>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>Client side creation of endpoints (APIs) rather than server side
      prebuilt endpoints.</li>
    <li>Use of Natural/Human Language, in my case English to create the
      code.</li>
    <li>Autonomy - the LLM directs the flow of the app.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>For the purpose of this talk I will use the term
    <code>function</code> in the mathematical sense:
  </p>
  <h3 id="input---functioninput---output---functionoutput---output2">input
    -&gt; function(input) -&gt; output -&gt; function(output) -&gt;
    output2</h3>
  <p><img src="./INPUT_OUTPUT.png" alt="input-output" /></p>
  <p>The <code>function</code> might be a Python function or a class.</p>
  <p>Before we go into some code examples, we will refresh ourselves that
    a REST API a request is sending a payload of data to a server and then
    the server returns a response.</p>
  <p>This is a very simple example of a REST API.</p>
  <p>Again, this is to demystify and simplify any libraries we may import
    for convenience functions.</p>
  <p>Authentication takes place by passing some sort of token to the
    server, usually in the headers:</p>
  <pre><code>model = &quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot;
model_endpoint = &quot;https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions&quot;

## There is no reference to previous requests to maintain a history - we must supply the history with each request.

headers = {
    &quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;application/json&quot;,
    &quot;Authorization&quot;: f&quot;Bearer {api_key}&quot;,
}

# payload may vary from LLM Organisation but it is a text string.
payload = {
   &quot;model&quot;: model,
   &quot;messages&quot;: [
       {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;system&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: system_prompt},
       {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: user_prompt},
   ],
   &quot;stream&quot;: False,
   &quot;temperature&quot;: temperature, 
}

# Use HTTP POST method
response = requests.post(
   url=model_endpoint, # The API
   headers=headers, # Headers for authentication etc
   data=json.dumps(payload) # The request data we are sending
).json()

# KEY TAKEAWAYs

## There is only one endpoint. We don&#39;t use other endpoints for differing tasks, there is just one end point and we will create our custom endpoint through prompt engineering.
</code></pre>
  <p>The request is text and does not contain any objects or other data
    types.</p>
  <p>Likewise, we get a text response. We pass some text to a function and
    get some text back.</p>
  <p>We will look at <code>01_openai_api_with_requests.ipynb</code> to see
    an example of getting a response from the LLM.</p>
  <p><code>01_openai_api_with_requests.ipynb</code>.</p>
  <p>In <code>02_api.ipynb</code>, we can see that we can get a joke from
    a regular API endpoint, with the assumption that there is no AI
    involved!</p>
  <p>We can also ask OpenAI to tell us a joke…</p>
  <p>What if we want a more complex API endpoint/route?</p>
  <p>Let’s say we want to get a joke, get a rating as well as a verdict on
    whether it is worthy of publishing or whether a HUMAN should make the
    joke for publishing.</p>
  <p>We can do this by using a prompt.</p>
  <p>The prompt is the input to the AI agent.</p>
  <p>The prompt can be considered to be the API route we are creating and
    it it will be in Natural Language.</p>
  <p>Let’s look at this file…</p>
  <p>We can see this in <code>02_api.ipynb</code> where we pass a system
    prompt and then a prompt to create this endpoint, specifying how we want
    the data returned.</p>
  <p>This is effectively a new route for the API, but instead of it being
    coded on the server side by someone, it is coded on the client side,
    sent with the payload AND the code is NATURAL LANGUAGE.</p>
  <p>In the early days of ChatGPT, <em>prompt engineering</em> was often
    shownd as hacks or tricks. Nowdays, it seems far more structured and
    different LLMs use different schemas.</p>
  <p>(Current models are ‘Imperative’ in that we say what they are, what
    they do, how they do it…New REASONING models are ‘Declarative’ in that
    we say what we want them to do - the goal - what we want as output and
    what we might not want. The model then ‘reasons’ its way through the
    task.)</p>
  <p>We can think of it as pseudo-code which we may write whilst
    developing an app.</p>
  <p>In fact, it is like a person starting a new job. They will get a
    handbook of what the job involves, how to do it etc. and this is what we
    are doing with the LLM. <code>sample_prompt.md</code> is an example of
    this and how we could import content from a Markdown file.</p>
  <p>We set the system prompt to guide the AI agent, and then the prompt
    to create the endpoint.</p>
  <p>We can have more information than necessary and this can do no harm
    provide it is consistent and logical with the remaining prompt.
    Obviously, there will be more token usage but with the price going down,
    it is not an issue.</p>
  <p>We have covered 2/3 of the AI reverse process - Client Side creation
    of the route and the use of Natural Language.</p>
  <p>What about Autonomy?</p>
  <p>In our output, we asked the LLM to give not just a rating but a
    verdict on whether it is worthy of publishing or not. This is the
    <code>next</code> parameter that is returned. This is our own creation
    and we can have any key name.
  </p>
  <p>There are many software design patterns but essentially the next step
    in the app has been selected by the LLM. It is the <code>if/else</code>
    statement. or router.</p>
  <p>In summary, this module has shown the 3 counter-intuitive steps of AI
    Agents - Autonomy, Client Side Creation of the route and the use of
    Natural Language.</p>
  <h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>
  <p>Sometimes we might think that AI Development is binary - it is fully
    AI or not.</p>
  <p>What if we can include ‘a bit of AI’ in our App? Remember, AI Agents
    are snippets of code that make a request and get a response.</p>
  <p>If we have a Search, FAQ or Help section, we can leverage the power
    of the AI Agent to create a facility to process Natural Language.
    Getting information from a form, (excluding text fields), give us
    structured input data and one text field may be used for the query as
    natural language input to be resolved by the AI Agent.</p>
  <p>Let’s look at <code>03_faq.ipynb</code> for a simple example. (We
    will see this in our Django demo and it is a view receiving some text
    and processing it to give text back to the user via a view).</p>
  <p>I am using Gradio as a UI for this example notebook and we can see
    that we have some data in the FAQ list.</p>
  <p>Obviously, this can be more involved and use structured inputs from
    associated form fields, but for now lets assume that we have extracted
    the relevant information.</p>
  <p>This highlights an important point that we don’t need to use LLMs for
    Agents. If we can get structured data from a form, then it is more
    deterministic and better. LLMs are very useful for converting Natural
    Language inputs to structured data.</p>
  <p>This is RAG or Retrieval Augmented Generation, where we ‘augment’ the
    query with the relevant data that the model was not trained on and then
    the LLM ‘generates’ the response based on the query, the data and the
    prompt. We tend to see RAG with vector databases and semantic search but
    RAG is essentially augmenting the LLM with our own data to ‘train’ it or
    ‘fine tune’.</p>
  <p>We can see that we can create a powerful AI Agent that can answer
    questions based on the data in the FAQ list.</p>
  <h2 id="django-demo">Django Demo</h2>
  <p>Let’s look at how this is done in Django.</p>
  <p>To keep the code similar tot he notebook, we will look at the
    <code>chatbot</code> app and the <code>views.py</code> file.
  </p>
  <p>There is a refactored version using HTMX in the
    <code>chatobt_app</code> app.
  </p>
  <p>I have already logged in so we can see the <code>chatbot</code> app
    in action as well as the <code>chabot_app</code> version.</p>
  <p>The key takeway is that the Django implementation is very similar to
    the notebook implementation with no special wiring involved.</p>
  <h1 id="router">ROUTER</h1>
  <p>We can further extend this to be a type of ROUTER or <em>if/else</em>
    statement to provide a sense of autonomy to the app - it will direct the
    flow of the app. We can have ‘Human in the Loop’ at any stage so that we
    restrict the flow to approved paths.</p>
  <p>We know the overall workflow of the app but not how it goes from
    beginning to end. We no longer micro-manage the app but delegate steps
    to the AI Agent, very much like we might manage a team member -
    mciro-manage or use delegation.</p>
  <p>In this example, we can let the AI Agent decide the next step to
    take.</p>
  <p>This was an example I had at a codebar coaching session where a
    student wanted to get a job in AI/Python.</p>
  <p>I asked if they had an AI department where they currently worked and
    they said NO.</p>
  <p>When I asked what they did, they would be the person people went to
    for help in deciding which report to run and then they would run it and
    send them the final report.</p>
  <p>I said to them that they could create an AI version of themself for
    when they were away. The app could offer a chatbot type interaction,
    along with a set of structured form fields like date-to etc and then
    select the best report and run it.</p>
  <p>When they said “And replace me out of a job!” I said “yes..you will
    have a new job as head of the AI dept team”.</p>
  <p>Let’s look at <code>04_agent_router.ipynb</code> as a very basic
    example of what they could do…I have included additional non-relevant
    reports/actions for demonstration purposes.</p>
  <p>We have not yet seen a multi agent scenario but I would describe this
    as everyday Python where we can use a range of Software Design Patterns
    like Author, Pub/Sub, Finite State Machine etc.</p>
  <p>We will take a look at this later.</p>
  <p>I think we can see that what we call these things - Agents, Tools,
    Routers, Functions - is quite arbitrary and merely a convenience for
    what works for us. At the end of the day, everything in Python is an
    OBJECT, so we can use whatever we want.</p>
  <p><img src="./ESSENCE.png" alt="ESSENCE" /></p>
  <h1 id="tools">TOOLS</h1>
  <p>AI Agents may need to get extra information by running functions.
    This is called ‘tool/function calling’ and is just a function call as in
    regular Python.</p>
  <p>We can get the LLM to not just select a tool but also extract the
    arguments. We will see information extraction in
    <code>06_information_extraction.ipynb</code>.
  </p>
  <p><code>05_tools.ipynb</code> shows not just how we define tools but
    also how an Agent can decide which one to use, as well as the arguments
    for the function.</p>
  <p>It will then send back the function name and arguments for us to run
    and then return the result.</p>
  <p><em>Where is it run?</em></p>
  <h2 id="from-openai-website">From OpenAI website</h2>
  <p>Function is run on our ‘box’ - we continue to add messages to our
    list of messages and send them to the LLM.</p>
  <p><img src="./images/where-tools-are-executed.png" alt="open-ai" /></p>
  <h1 id="data-extraction">DATA EXTRACTION</h1>
  <p>We can use the LLM to extract data from a document. This is called
    ‘information extraction’. We will see this in
    <code>06_information_extraction.ipynb</code>.
  </p>
  <p><img src="./ESSENCE.png" alt="ESSENCE" /></p>
  <p>I bring this up again as I came across this extraction pattern in an
    example of ‘Teachable Agents’. This sounded very futuristic but looking
    at the code, it is information extraction that can be stored in short
    term memory - app level cache - or long term menory - stored in a DB for
    example and retrieved as needed and added to the SYSTEM MESSAGE.</p>
  <p>Examples show this for data pipelines, however, if it were part of an
    invoicing process one would more likely have the information stored
    rather than in a prepared document.</p>
  <h1 id="4-main-patterns">4 main patterns</h1>
  <p>Andrew Ng describes four main patterns</p>
  <p>https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/how-agents-can-improve-llm-performance/</p>
  <p><img src="./images/4-patterns.png" alt="patterns" /></p>
  <p>We have seen examples of these in this talk, bar a multi-agent
    pattern.</p>
  <h2 id="reflection-pattern">REFLECTION PATTERN</h2>
  <p><img src="./INPUT_OUTPUT.png" alt="REFLECTION" /></p>
  <p>input -&gt; function(input) -&gt; output -&gt; function(output) -&gt;
    output2</p>
  <p>We generate a response with our first query using a system prompt to
    create code.</p>
  <p>We then pass the output into another function that acts as a reviewer
    to produce the next version of the code.</p>
  <p>Many times when we use ChatGPT say, we ask for it to refine its
    previous answer. This is the Reflection pattern where we send the
    previous response and then ask it to refine it.</p>
  <p>In fact, it is like RAG. The first request generates some content,
    which we then add to the next request which has a system prompt of being
    a critique.</p>
  <p>We can repeat this as many times as we want, adding previous
    responses to the next request.</p>
  <p><code>15_reflection_pattern.ipynb</code> shows how we can use this
    pattern.</p>
  <h2 id="tools-1">TOOLS</h2>
  <p>We have seen Tool Calling previously.</p>
  <h2 id="planning">PLANNING</h2>
  <p>A powerful pattern is the ReAct (Reason-Act) pattern.</p>
  <p>This can be viewed of as Multi-Step. Let’s go through the code.</p>
  <p>To get a sense of how it works, look at
    <code>20_planning_agent_w_loop.py</code> as we can get a high level
    overview of the code, whereas
    <code>20_planning_agent_no_loop.ipynb</code> needs more of a walk
    through.

  <h2 id="multi-agent">MULTI AGENT</h2>
  <h3 id="libraries">Libraries</h3>
  <p>I like to think of Libraries as frameworks without the framework! By
    this I mean we get building blocks to help us build things without
    having to conform to a building plan.</p>
  <h4 id="pydantic-ai">Pydantic AI</h4>
  <p>Pydantic is well known in everyday Python and is used by most AI
    Agent frameworks as structured data validation is vital.</p>
  <p>PydanticAI is a library/framework that uses Pydantic to create AI
    Agents.</p>
  <h4 id="huggingface-smolagents">Huggingface SmolAgents</h4>
  <p>HF SmolAgents is a library/framework that uses Huggingface
    Transformers to create AI Agents. It has broken new ground throught the
    use of its CodeAgent where tool calling is done via Python rather than
    JSON…show images…</p>
  <h3 id="crewsswarms">Crews/Swarms</h3>
  <p>Crews and Swarms are design patterns for MultiAgent collaboration.
    They each have their own use cases and we saw earlier that AI Agents can
    emit the ‘next’ step in the app which a range of desing patterns can
    harness.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>https://aiagentsdirectory.com/category/ai-agents-frameworks</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="frameworks">Frameworks</h2>
  <p>There are many frameworks and libraries that can be used to create AI
    Agents. Some are more focused on the AI Agent and some are more focused
    on the UI.</p>
  <p>LlamaIndex Langchain Langraph AutoGen CrewAI</p>
  <p>And there are many low/no code versions as we saw in the <a
      href="https://aiagentsdirectory.com/category/ai-agents-frameworks">AI
      Agents Directory</a></p>
  <h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
  <p>I hope AI Agents have been demystified and helped us understand what
    they can do, enabling us to either build our own frameworks or use
    existing ones, with a deeper appreciation and understanding of how they
    work.</p>
